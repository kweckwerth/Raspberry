This is my first attempt at a compiled Angular deployment to display a list of Youtube videos using Tomcat.  Checkout my other project 

To Run
------
1)  Run index.html on a Tomcat webserver.
2)  You should see videos playing automatically.

Note:  To configure videos simply change the assets/urls.json and refresh browser.
