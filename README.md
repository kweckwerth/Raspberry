This is my first attempt at a compiled Angular deployment to display a list of Youtube videos using Tomcat.  Checkout my other project "AngularYoutubePlayer" for the source code to this.  This project was meant to share for deployment purposes.

To Run
------
1)  Run index.html on a Tomcat webserver.
2)  You should see videos playing automatically.

Note:  To configure videos simply change the assets/urls.json and refresh browser.
